%# RH - 7/5/2006: Ripped all code from Ticket/Element/EditBasics to provide
%# ticket field editing at the top of the Ticket display page for IMS group.
                                                                                                                   
%# RH - 7/12/2006: Target Display.html instead of Modify.html because we want
%# the user to stay in that page once she/he is done saving changes to the TISBasics
%# section.
